            <h1>Project Details</h1>
            <p>
                This project is an experiment of natural interaction techniques in virtual reality, taking form in a cooking game. The game, Terra Pizza, requires the player to put together a set of pizza orders, by assembling different ingredients and delivering them to a desired state. The game is meant to provide varying forms of natural humaninteraction in VR, by allowing the player to interact with their virtual environment in the same way they would interact with a real-world environment. This is done through facilitating object manipulation in a direct fashion, as well as using an intermediate tool.

            <p>
                The project was created using Unity 2019, and all component code was written in C#.

            <h2><a>Implementation Details</a></h2>
            <p>
                This project takes advantage of Unityâ€™s inherent component-based design approach. It defines the behaviourof different game elements using component scripts that can be re-used and applied to any game component.Additionally, it defines a few paired component behaviours, where it governs the modes of interaction betweentwo coupled game objects. Below are some of the functionalities implemented:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Slicing:
                    <p>
                        The behaviour of the slicing tool was implemented by defining the interaction between a slicing object and a sliceable object. A slicing object has a slicing plane associated with it using which collision with a sliceable object is detected. Upon interaction with a sliceable object's mesh the intersection between the slicing plane and the mesh is computed. It is then used to generate two meshes (a positive and a negative mesh) on either side of the plane. Mesh components (submeshes, vertices, normals, colors, etc.) are computed for each child mesh based on the parent mesh, and two new game objects are created with these meshes specified.

                <li>
                    Deformation:
                    <p>
                        Dough deformation was implemented by defining the interaction between a deformable object (the dough), and a deform-er object (the rolling pin). Deformation is performed by altering the scale, along a specific axis, of the object being deformed. This behaviour is not triggered by a collision, but by casting a ray from a deform-er to a deformable object, and determining when a minimum threshold distance is reached to begin "deformation" and achieve a desired result.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Topping Dispensers:
                    <p>
                        Topping dispenser components (sauce dispenser, cheese dispenser, scoop, etc.) utilize a selection of interaction techniques. Some of them use motion pattern detection behaviours, where once a motion pattern is detected toppings are dispensed from the container. Others employ a different natural method of interaction via transporting objects using a tool (e.g. a scoop carring toppings) around the game scene, and eventually dispensing/detaching these objects from the transportation tool.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The game also employed a number of game-play management tools, such as random order generation, and order validation and scoring.
